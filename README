Scanner Button Daemon (scanbuttond), Version 0.2.1
==================================================


First things first
------------------

This software is in its very early stages of development.
There may be tons of critical bugs, and it's unlikely that
this software will work straight out of the box.
Note that this daemon requires root privileges which
should be considered a security risk.
Be prepared for the worst!


Introduction
------------

Modern scanners usually have several front panel buttons
which are intended to trigger certain actions like
copying, faxing or mailing the scanned document.
This daemon monitors the scanner's buttons and runs a
shell script whenever one of these buttons has been 
pressed. Because it is accessing the scanner directly
via libusb, there should be no conflicts with SANE
or other scanner drivers: scanbuttond simply won't touch
the scanner hardware while you are using SANE.


Requirements
------------

Scanner: see "supported scanners" below
Operating system: Linux (and perhaps other Unix-like systems)
Connection: USB (using libusb, the scanner kernel module is 
            currently unsupported)


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

type
> make clean
> make
> make install

This will install the following files:
/usr/local/bin/scanbuttond
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libepson.so
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libepson.so.1
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libepson.so.1.0
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libplustek.so
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libplustek.so.1
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libplustek.so.1.0
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libmeta.so
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libmeta.so.1
/usr/local/lib/scanbuttond/libmeta.so.1.0
/etc/scanbuttond/buttonpressed.sh
/etc/scanbuttond/meta.conf


Usage
-----

type
> scanbuttond

If everyhing works, scanbuttond will fork() to background.
To see what scanbuttond is doing, you can have a look at your
system log, for example /var/log/everything/current (for Gentoo
Linux systems).

Currently, there is no "proper" way to quit scanbuttond.
Just kill it, for example by typing
> killall scanbuttond
That should do the job. Scanbuttond installs a signal handler
which should ensure a clean shutdown even when it's killed.


Supported scanners
------------------

Using the epson backend and libusb connection:
* Epson Expression 1600 (expected to work)
* Epson Expression 1680 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 610 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 636U (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 640 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1200U (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1240 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1640 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1650 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1660 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 2400 (working, tested)
* Epson Perfection 2450 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 3200 (expected to work)
* Epson CX3200 (working, tested)

Using the plustek backend and libusb connection:
* Canon CanonScan N1220U (experimental)

Note: the plustek backend is considered experimental, and I
strongly advise you to have a look at backends/plustek.c before
attempting to use it.


How to link actions to buttons
------------------------------

Whenever a scanner button has been pressed, scanbuttond
starts a shell script and passes it the button number and
the SANE scanner name as command line arguments.
By default, this shell script is installed as
/etc/scanbuttond/buttonpressed.sh. 
Please modify it to fit your purposes.


How to contribute to this project
---------------------------------

The development of scanbuttond should not be dependent on one 
single person, but a community effort.
You could help by ...

 * adding or enhancing a scanner backend
 * adding or enhancing a connection interface
 * implementing a proper shutdown mechanism
 * doing some extensive testing
 * sending patches
 * sending bug reports
 * mailing ideas how to enhance scanbuttond
