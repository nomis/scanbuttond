# This script is started by scanbuttond whenever a scanner button has been pressed.
# Scanbuttond passes the following parameters to us:
# $1 ... the button number
# $2 ... the scanner's SANE device name, which comes in handy if there are two or 
#        more scanners. In this case we can pass the device name to SANE programs 
#        like scanimage.

		# Fine-tuned for the Epson Perfection 2400, the HP LaserJet 1200 and
